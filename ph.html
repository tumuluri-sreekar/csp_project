        <h1>What is Personal Hygiene.......</h1>
        <div class="a">
            <p> Good personal hygiene involves keeping all parts of the external body clean and healthy. It is important for maintaining both physical and mental health.

                In people with poor personal hygiene, the body provides an ideal environment for germs to grow, leaving it vulnerable to infection.
                
                On a social level, people may avoid a person with poor personal hygiene, which may result in isolation and loneliness.</p>
