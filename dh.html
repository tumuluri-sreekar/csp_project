        <p> domestic hygiene (sanitary preparation of food, cleanliness, and ventilation) means cleanliness in your home whereas personal hygiene (proper living habits, cleanliness of body and clothing, healthful diet, a balanced regimen of rest and exercise) means cleanliness of your person or your body.</p>
        <p>Domestic hygiene activities include all the work which is done to keep the house and people's clothes and bedding clean. These jobs include sweeping and washing floors, cleaning the toilet, washing clothes and bedding, and washing dishes and cooking utensils after meals. It is important that the house be kept clean so that it is a healthy place. If the house and everything in it are not cleaned often, moisture and dirt gather and it becomes an ideal place for germs, parasites and vectors (disease-carrying animals) to breed and multiply. These germs can cause the people living in the house to get sick.</p>
