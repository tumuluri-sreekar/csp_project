    Life without good health is like an army without soldiers and chocolate without cocoa. Health is important to live life to the fullest.
When a person leads a healthy lifestyle, the body remains healthy and the mind is active and fresh.
Living a healthy life would extend longevity and also regenerate the body and mind.
Having good health is of core importance to human happiness.
The state of complete physical, mental and spiritual well-being is called health. Health consists of maintaining the body and taking preventive measures to reduce the possibility of developing various diseases.

<p style="font-size:2vw;text-align: justify;padding-left:1.1vw;padding-right: 1.1vw;">
    Hygiene is a series of practices performed to preserve health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), "Hygiene refers to conditions and practices that help to maintain health and prevent the spread of diseases."
    Many people equate hygiene with 'cleanliness,' but hygiene is a broad term. It includes such personal habit choices as how frequently to take a shower or bath, wash hands, trim fingernails, and wash clothes. It also includes attention to keeping surfaces in the home and workplace clean, including bathroom facilities. Some regular hygiene practices may be considered good habits by the society, while the neglect of hygiene can be considered disgusting, disrespectful, or threatening.

                Over half of all Indians, especially women, eat an unbalanced diet devoid of fresh fruits, green vegetables, pulses, 
                meat and milk products that are needed to lead a healthy life. The recently released National Family Health Survey 
                (NFHS-4) 2015-16 by the health ministry revealed that fewer than half (47%) of all women consume dark green, leafy 
                vegetables daily and another 38% eat them only once a week.

                  A well-balanced diet is one that contains enough proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals.The NFHS-4 showed
                 that only half (45%) of women eat pulses or beans daily and an equal percentage consume them weekly. Milk or curd is consumed 
                 daily by 45% of women and weekly by 23%. Seven percent never have either milk or curd and 25% consume these dairy products only 
                 occasionally. <a href="surveypage.html">Read More..</a>

                  Food gives our bodies the energy we need to function. Food is also a part of traditions and culture. 
                  This can mean that eating has an emotional component as well.
